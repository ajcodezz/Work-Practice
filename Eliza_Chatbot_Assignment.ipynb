        "Course: AIT 516 - Natural Language Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "Date: 6/4/2025\n",

        "Group 6 Members: Michelle James, Oeeshik Kundu, Alyssa Paige, Varun Gunda\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "This code simulates a chatbot modeled after Eliza, a classic psychotherapist chatbot. It interacts with users by processing their input, reflecting their emotional cues and intentions, and generating meaningful, empathetic responses. The chatbot aims to engage users in reflective dialogue, mimicking a therapeutic conversation to help users explore their thoughts and feelings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples of Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. User starts the program and is greeted by Eliza, who asks for the user’s name.\n",
        "2. User inputs their name (e.g., \"Michelle\").\n",
        "3. Eliza prompts the user for input (e.g., \"Hi, Michelle! How can I help you today?\").\n",
        "- User enters sentences like:\n",
        "    > \"I'm feeling sad today.\"\n",
        "    Eliza might respond:\n",
        "    > \"Why do you feel sad?\"\n",
        "4. If the user types \"bye\", \"quit\", or \"exit\", Eliza will respond with a goodbye message and end the conversation.\n",
        "5. The chatbot supports expansions of contractions (\"I'm\" -> \"I am\") and reflects pronouns to maintain natural dialogue.\n",
        "6. Bonus: The bot recognizes emotions, keywords, and duration phrases, providing tailored responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Instructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Run the program in a Python 3 environment with NLTK installed.\n",
        "2. At the prompt, enter your name when asked.\n",
        "3. Type your messages and press Enter to chat with Eliza.\n",
        "4. To end the conversation, type \"bye\", \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"stop\".\n",
        "5. If you enter empty input, Eliza will prompt you to try again.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Algorithm Overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:**\n",
        "   - Download required NLTK data packages (wordnet, punkt, stopwords, etc.).\n",
        "   - Define mappings for contractions, pronouns, emotion keywords, and transformation patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Preprocessing:**\n",
        "   - Convert user input to lowercase.\n",
        "   - Expand contractions to their full forms for clarity.\n",
        "   - Remove trailing punctuation for uniform processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **User Interaction Loop:**\n",
        "   - Greet the user and prompt for their name.\n",
        "   - Enter the main chat loop:\n",
        "     a. Receive user input.\n",
        "     b. If input is empty, prompt user to try again.\n",
        "     c. Check if user wants to quit (matches quit keywords).\n",
        "     d. If quitting, respond with a farewell message and exit.\n",
        "     e. Otherwise, preprocess input.\n",
        "     f. Attempt to match input against predefined transformation patterns and keyword responses.\n",
        "     g. Check for emotion-related input to produce empathetic replies.\n",
        "     h. Detect duration phrases (example “2 years”) and reflect back for depth.\n",
        "     i. Reflect pronouns in the fallback response to personalize replies.\n",
        "     j. If no pattern matches, respond with a generic backup prompt to encourage more input.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Response Generation:**\n",
        "   - Select an appropriate response based on the first successful pattern or keyword match.\n",
        "   - Format the response dynamically with captured user input where applicable.\n",
        "   - Provide fallback responses when no other matches are found.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Repeat:**\n",
        "   - Continue the loop until the user issues a quit command or interrupts the program.\n"
